# GiphyAPI
This is my homework using Giphy API.


What is your project? Giphy API Calls

What is the intended use of your project? The intended use of the project is to develop a greater skill set for API calls.

How does it work? It allows the user to pick a topic of gif he or she would like to see, creates a button that will call those gifs, and show a list of different gifs.

Who uses it? Users who want to see gifs of different topics.

How can others benefit from using your project? It saves them time and hassle in finding gifs they would like to see.

Items you haven't been able to implement/fix yet? None, simple project but always more can be done.

Features that would could possibly be added in the future? Styling.
